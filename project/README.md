Now that you understood the basics of streamlit, its your turn!

Try to create an streamlit application, using at least all of those features:
- Markdown;
- Dataframes;
- 2 types of interactivity (checkbox and selectbox, for example);
- 2 types of plot;
- Call an external .py file if one type of input is selected;
